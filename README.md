*Business problem:* 
Best Buy's Marketplace Sellers do not always have the resources to provide sufficient product specifications, titles, short and long descriptions, and images. They also do not always realize the benefits of spending the effort to attain the necessary content.
A solution is needed to use existing data to augment and suggest seller provided content and making the possible impact of the enhancements visible to sellers in a way that they will want to spend more time improving their product content.

*Solution:*
Ideated and simulated the model in Power BI. Using the dashboard can motivate each seller to improve their product attributes leading to a rise in their product rank on the marketplace.
